# Payant-V1

# The real problem

The major pain point of client-contractor relationships is trust:<br/>
-> Will I get paid on time after I've delivered?<br/>
-> Will the contractor deliver if he/she is paid beforehand?<br/>
-> What if I am not happy with the work?

# Our solution

-> A simple 'plug and play' Web 2.5 escrow for payments and deliverables.<br/>
-> Removing the need for trust between contractors and clients (and customers) in an easy to use UI on top of simple Smart Contracts with legal contracts and case resolution for users.

# Why Payant?

Payant will make client-contractor relationships trustless.<br/>
-> Seamless user experience putting the tech, the smart contracts and the swaps under the hood and focusing on providing value for our users.<br/>
-> Transactions are wrapped with legal contracts- so you have peace of mind. If you're unhappy with a client's decision, this makes case resolution simple and quick.

# Basic B2B User Flow V1

1. Drag and drop invoice PDF<br/>
2. Client get notified - Clients deposit to escrow on chain<br/>
3. Contractor upload deliverables to smart contract<br/>
4. Client gets notified - Clients confirms or ask for revisions<br/>
5. Contractor withdraws (USDC)

# How it actually works

I'm a contractor and I don't know my new client, or if I will get paid on time.<br/>

1. Create a Payment account [email+ password+ usdc wallet address]<br/>
2. Create an invoice<br/>
3. Upload invoice to Payant<br/>
4. Client confirms & pays via their USDC wallet [signs the transactions on chain]<br/>
5. I upload deliverable<br/>
6. Client confirms the work is done (signs on chain)<br/>
7. I receive the funds minus the withdrawal fee.
